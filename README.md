# CV/Resume
A CV generated with the Pagedown package in R. This project template has been made from using a combination of two template sources with a mix of some of my own coding solutions.

## Disclaimer
This project was largely created using templates provided by the pagedown package and Nick Strayer. All css styling in this project  was created by Nick Strayer, with the only variation being a change in font style.
